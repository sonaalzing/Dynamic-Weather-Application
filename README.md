# Weather-App
Hi Everyone!
I have created a new web application with JavaScript (Vanilla JavaScript: No Framework).
It will show the weather information that it will get from the API like this, an Icon that shows the weather status, the temperature value in Celsius unit, the weather description, and then the user's city and country.
The API provider is https://www.weatherapi.com/
